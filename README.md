# Violent Python
Selection of various scripts from TJ O'Connor's Violent Python by Syngress

### Getting Started
Please don't use this repo for anything legitimate. You're free to copy the code, clone it, and modify it (see license)
but I'd rather you buy TJ O'Connor's book and do the exercises/projects yourself.

### Prerequisites
Python 3.x

### Using/Installing
Please don't. I expect much of this not to work.

### Testing
No unit testing or additional tests/frameworks defined yet for this project.

### Coding Style
No specific stylistic model used.

## Deployment
I do not recommend you use this code on a live system, this was created purely to host my code as I learned more about Python

## Built With
Pipenv - Package management and virtual environment handling
PyCharm - IDE

## Contributing
This isn't a repo maintained for necessariliy contributing and improving the content. I am sharing this just to host
an external copy of the effort as I go through TJ's book.

## Versioning
No specific versioning system/format defined/selected.
